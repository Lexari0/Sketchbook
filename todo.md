- [ ] New image upload
- [ ] Update image upload
- [ ] Mount USB drives to content folder
- [ ] Config wiki/documentation
- [ ] API endpoints wiki/documentation
- [ ] Database wiki/documentation
- [ ] Create nginx reverse proxy on Pi
- [ ] Add an "admin" panel (must be local or whitelisted to view)
-- [ ] Show software info (name, version, etc. from config)
-- [ ] "Whitelist this address" button if none is set
-- [ ] Show address whitelist and "Clear whitelist" button if one is set
-- [ ] Check boxes for config books
-- [ ] Drop downs for config options (eg: apis enabled)
-- [ ] Text inputs for config fields (eg: owner and email)
-- [ ] Config options should all have hover tooltip descriptions
-- [ ] Links to log files
--- [ ] Recent log messages
-- [ ] SQL command entry (if /api/sql endpoint is enabled; warn that this is dangerous)
-- [ ] Force reset database (warn that this is dangerous)
-- [ ] Update WiFi credentials form
--- [ ] Revert if connection fails for 1 minute
-- [ ] "Restart" and "Update" buttons
---  [ ] Check for updates (display change logs)
-- [ ] "Refresh SSL Certificate" button
- [ ] Add server domain field to config
- [ ] Clean up Pi (reset git repository)
- [ ] Create systemd service
- [ ] Install certbot
-- [ ] Create disk image from Pi SD
- [ ] Setup walkthrough
-- [ ] Determine if port 443 and 80 are in use
--- [ ] If not, determine if port forwarding is possible (may need to make Godot HTML project to create websocket server in browser)
-- [ ] Set up Raspberry Pi SD from image
--- [ ] Set WiFi credentials if using WiFi
-- [ ] Put SD card in Pi and connect power (Ethernet if not using WiFi)
-- [ ] Scan for sketchbook.local from browser
--- [ ] Might fail if the Pi did not connect to the same network or if mDNS is not available. As a backup the Pi should write it's local IP address to a file in /boot
-- [ ] Forward port 443 and 80 to Sketchbook's IP address
--- [ ] Confirm Sketchbook is reached on WAN port 80; continue setup locally
--- [ ] Input desired domain and trigger certbot
---- [ ] certbot may fail, display stdout and stderr via websocket
---- [ ] If certbot succeeds, try to GET /api/server.
----- [ ] If that fails, warn that port 443 may not be forwarded properly and show a button to check again
---- [ ] Enable "force https" nginx site and show link to "finish setup"
-- [ ] "Congratulations on finishing setup!" Recommend "adding content" guide.
